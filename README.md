DTW

**Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)** is an algorithm that can be used to determine the similarity between two time-series sequences. Usage of DTW is advantageous over methods that perform a direct comparison of time-series sequences like Euclidean Matching because of the flexibility inherent to DTW towards misalignment and stretching of time-series signals. As shown in Figure 1, DTW is better able to detect contour similarity between two time-series signals while Euclidean Matching could yield results that imply dissimilarity when two time-series signals actually have similar contours.


We can perform DTW on two signals to determine their similarity by filling out a grid with the computational algorithm shown in Figure 2.
